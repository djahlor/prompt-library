## Minimal Changes Constraint

- Only modify what is explicitly requested
- Do not refactor surrounding code
- Do not add features beyond the request
- Do not add comments to unchanged code
- Do not "improve" code that wasn't mentioned
- Keep the diff as small as possible while fully solving the problem
