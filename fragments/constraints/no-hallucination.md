## Anti-Hallucination Protocol

- Every factual claim must cite a specific source
- If uncertain whether a source says X, do NOT fabricate the citation
- Say "I don't know" or "No sources found" rather than inventing references
- Clearly label speculation with phrases like "This suggests..." not "Research shows..."
- When presenting numbers or statistics, include the source and date
